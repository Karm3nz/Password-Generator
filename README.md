# Password Generator

## Description 
Do you lack the creativity, time, and energy to create a password? Have no fear the password generator is here!

The making of this password generator is exactly as it sounds, to create a unique password. The motivation of this project is to create a tool that helps with creating passwords effortlessly and simply. It is a password generator that allows the user to customize their password to include/exclude different types of character, as well as adjust the length of the passwords suited to their needs. 

From this project, I've learned that it is time well-spent looking at various related projects from other people to help out with understanding the codes better. It also helps to tinker, try, and test out different possibilities to see if algorithms will work. 

This password generator notably utilizes the Unicode character code, math floor function, and math random function to shuffle chracters.
