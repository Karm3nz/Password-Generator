# Password Generator

## Description 
Do you lack the creativity, time, and energy to create a password? Have no fear the password generator is here!

The making of this password generator is exactly as it sounds, to create a unique password. It is a password generator that allows the user to customize their password to include/exclude different types of character, as well as adjust the length of the passwords suited to their needs. 

From this project, I've learned that it is time well-spent looking at various related projects from other people to help out with understanding the codes better. It also helps to tinker, try, and test out different possibilities to see if algorithms will work. 

This password generator notably utilizes the Unicode character code, math floor function, and math random function to shuffle chracters. 


The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.
